# Arduino
Arduino Project using a DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity, Water Level Sensor, and an LED. This basic project uses Python and C++, and Flask to implement a web page to retrieve data from the Arduino board and display it using a REST API.

Description
This project involves:

DHT11 Sensor: Measures temperature and humidity.
Water Level Sensor: Monitors the water level.
LED: Indicates system status.
Flask: Provides a web interface to display sensor data retrieved via a REST API.
